  --> collection event : add
     note: IDMap is transactional, so it's 'safe' to store the
           view representation there instantly
     - create view representation + store in IDMap
       ; the problem here might be that the path is incomplete
       ; before the txn commits
     - determine if action is required
        - if so --> store that action in TxnLocal

  --> collection event : remove
     - look up view representation + remove from IDMap
         // there will be exactly one full entry in the map
         // ; it should thus be possible to construct a
         // removal algorithm without going into BDB cursors
         // and other nasty stuff, keeping the KV store
         // still opaque
         // --> that is --> we find the full key, we can
         // construct the partial keys and remove them?
         // (is there any chance that we may accidentally
         //  remove a partial key that points to another
         //  full key?)
     - determine if action is required
