a memorising RNG

RNG {
   time: S#Var[ S#Acc ]
   realisations: S#Var[ Double ]

   def current : Double = realisations.access( time() )()  // ?
}

aka Expr.Gen ?

would be nice to have a form of incremental indices, too. like rng.numRealisations; rng.select( idx )

so an alternative representation would be

Expr.Gen[ A ] {
   current: S#Var[ A ]
   ?
}
