/**Â This class helps overcome the limitation of scala's implicit resolution -- by resolving an expression
  * system's type parameter `S`. There are two types of conversions, those that can be run from the underlying
  * expression type (e.g. `longOps1` provides operations which can be invoked with a plain `Long`), and those
  * that require an existing expression (e.g. `longOps2`). This is so that primitive standard operations remain
  * outside the implicit scope (e.g. addition on longs).
